To make your custom dataset follow the following steps but if you want to run the program with the existing data then skip collecting portion


1. run the data_collection.py
2. Enter the label (sign name) and press enter
3. the model will start collecting data when you hit space bar key and pause when you hit space bar key so it will be easy for you to collect the data
4. After collecting the data press 'q' so it will save that data for the corresponding label in a .csv file
5. If you want to collect data for another sign after pressing 'q' just type the name of the new label and repeat the process.


data_training
1. After you collected the data run the training file it will take a few minuites to train depending upon your data


detecting
